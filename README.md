# A Journey to Find the Members of the Praesepe Star Cluster
  
## Introduction :
This is my project on astronomy in Feb. 2021. The reasons and ideas of each steps of my project have been recorded in the .ipynb file , so please read carefully .
tars we see in the night sky were once born in groups-- a place we called “Star Cluster.” After stellar objects (stars) are born, they should remain closed in space, as you can see the bright stars gathering for the Praesepe in the figure on the right. Stars born together will most certainly share similar velocities and ages. As time goes by, cluster members will begin to set apart by the mutual interaction between members or being pulled apart by the Galactic tidal forces then become unbounded. These unbounded stars are then called field stars, where 99% of the stars you see at night are field stars.  
Here, the project will try to find the members of the Praesepe star cluster using the features of star cluster mention above: the same space, location, the same velocity, and the same age.
